Don\\'t forget Syria!\" The leaders of Turkey and Russia said the attack in Ankara, the Turkish capital, was an attempt to disrupt efforts to repair ties between their countries, which have backed opposing sides in the Syrian civil war. An Associated Press photographer and others at the art gallery watched in horror as the gunman, who was wearing a dark suit and tie, fired at least eight shots, at one point walking around Ambassador Andrei Karlov as he lay motionless and shooting him again at close range. The assailant, who was identified as Mevlut Mert Altintas, a 22-year-old member of Ankara\\'s riot police squad, was later killed in a shootout with police. Three other people were wounded in the attack, authorities said. The assassination came after days of protests by Turks angry over Russia\\'s support for President Bashar Assad in the Syrian conflict and Russia\\'s role in the bombardment and destruction of Aleppo, Syria\\'s largest city. The gunman shouted about Aleppo in Turkish, and also yelled \"Allahu akbar,\" the Arabic phrase for \"God is great,\" continuing in Arabic: \"We are the descendants of those who supported the Prophet Muhammad, for jihad.\" The attack, condemned by the White House and the United Nations, was another sign of how Turkey, a NATO member and a partner in the U.S.-led campaign against the Islamic State group, is struggling to contain multiple security threats. The war in Syria has been a major problem for years, sending several million refugees into Turkey and, more recently, drawing in Turkish troops. Turkey has become accustomed to deadly attacks - Kurdish militants claimed responsibility for Dec. 10 bombings in Istanbul that killed 44 people, many of them police. The spectacle of 62-year-old Karlov\\'s assassination by a member of the Turkish security forces at a photography exhibit meant to highlight Russian culture reinforced the sense of unease over the region\\'s conflict and complex web of alliances and relationships. It came a day before a key meeting about Syria to be held in Moscow. Those attending include the foreign and defence',\n",

Granville County Fire Marshal Doug Logan said the blaze was set intentionally, destroying the house. Video showed that it left little more than the home\\'s front steps, its foundation and some scorched framing. The county\\'s sheriff, Brindell B.

Leelah explained that she always felt like a girl and wanted her parents to accept that. They did not, mother Carla Alcorn told CNN, for religious reasons. Though she loved her child, the mother struggled to wrap her mind around what transgender means. \"The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren\\'t treated the way I was, they\\'re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights,\" Leelah pleaded in her note. \"My death needs to be counted.\" There is more information than ever about transgender people -- from new research to a freshly written book of personal essays, \"Trans Bodies, Trans Selves\" to the critically acclaimed new Amazon series \"Transparent.\" What is transgender? Transgender is an umbrella term for people whose gender identity, expression or behavior does not conform to the sex they were assigned at birth, according to American Psychological Association, which recently posted a Q&A on the topic. Sex is different from gender: Sex refers to genitalia, and gender is the cultural construct society has created to differentiate between men and women. Transgender also gets confused with sexual orientation. Just because someone is transgender doesn\\'t mean they are gay, lesbian or bisexual. It\\'s also important to know the difference between transgender people and transsexuals. Transsexuals alter or want to change their bodies by using hormones, surgery or other means to come more in line with the gender with which they associate, the association says. Not all transgender people want to change their bodies. Although it may seem like a relatively new topic, transgender people have been documented since antiquity in many cultures around the world. A transgender person has told you they are transgender. What\\'s the first thing you should say? Some experts say you should try this: \"I love you and support you.\" That first reaction from a friend or family member whose judgment matters is critical, said Aidan Key, the founder of the family education and support organization Gender Diversity in Washington. \"Consider that they\\'re facing many other challenges, and you can offer a place where they can simply be accepted, a place without struggle.\" Chances are very good it',\n",

His family said he passed away, at home, from \"natural causes due to heart failure.\" Cuomo was governor for three terms, from 1983 to 1995. He was married to his wife, Matilda, for more than six decades. They had five children, including current New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who was sworn in for his second term Thursday, and Chris Cuomo, host of CNN\\'s \"New Day.\" Asked once how he wanted to be remembered, Mario Cuomo replied: \"One of the simple things I wanted to achieve is -- I want to be governor. I want to be the hardest working there ever was. And I want, when it\\'s over -- and I figured on four years at first -- I want people to say, now, there was an honest person.\"Cuomo burst onto the national political stage with his keynote address at the 1984 Democratic National Convention. To say he was a powerful speaker would be an understatement. A Queens native, Cuomo was born in New York City, in the apartment above his father\\'s grocery store. After a brief shot at a career in minor league baseball, he pursued a law degree and graduated at the top of his class at St. John\\'s University School of Law. Although the allure of public service was strong, Cuomo\\'s early attempts at seeking political office ended in defeat. His first electoral success came in 1978 as running mate to former Gov. Hugh Carey. Four years later, Carey stepped aside, and Cuomo entered the race and won.',\n",

In 2016, Thanksgiving is on November 24.Facts: AAA forecasts 48.7 million Americans will travel 50 miles or more for Thanksgiving in 2016. According to the USDA, 243 million turkeys are expected to be raised in the United States in 2016. 859 million pounds of cranberries are expected to be produced in the United States in 2016. The president traditionally receives a turkey in a ceremony at the White House a few days before Thanksgiving Day. President Harry S. Truman started the tradition and President George H. W. Bush was the first to pardon the bird and not eat it. Timeline: Fall 1621 - The first Thanksgiving is observed in Plymouth. A good harvest leads Massachusetts Governor William Bradford to plan a festival to give thanks. Around 90 Native Americans attend. 1789 - President George Washington issues a proclamation naming November 26 a day of national thanksgiving. There was no national Thanksgiving Day for several years, but many states had Thanksgiving holidays. October 3, 1863 - President Abraham Lincoln proclaims the last Thursday in November as a national day of thanksgiving. 1939 - President Franklin D. Roosevelt moves Thanksgiving Day one week earlier to boost the Christmas shopping season. 1941 - Congress rules that the fourth Thursday in November will be observed as Thanksgiving Day and a federal legal holiday.\",\n",

His daughters, Malia and Sasha, often join their father for the tongue-in-cheek Rose Garden Ceremony. Not this year. \"Of course, Thanksgiving is a family holiday as much as a national one. So for the past seven years, I\\'ve established another tradition: embarrassing my daughters with a corny-copia of Dad jokes about turkeys,\" Obama said. \"This year they had a scheduling conflict,\" he deadpanned. The president was joined in the Rose Garden by his nephews instead. He joked that he planned to keep up the tradition during his post presidency. After finishing his remarks, filled with puns, the president blessed a 40-pound (18-kg) fowl from Iowa, granting it a long life and a pardon from appearing on an American dinner table. A backup turkey also had its life spared. Their names: \"Tot\" and \"Tater.\"',\n",

Richard Spencer, leader of the National Policy Institute, was invited to speak by Preston Wiginton, a former student at the university, located in College Station, Texas, according to school newspaper The Battalion. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate speech, said Wiginton is a prominent white supremacist living part of the time in Russia. Texas A&M said its leaders find Spencer\\'s views in direct conflict with the university\\'s core values. \"To be clear, Texas A&M University - including faculty, staff, students and/or student groups - did not invite this speaker to our campus nor do we endorse his rhetoric in any way,\" Amy Smith, the university\\'s senior vice president and chief marketing and communications officer, said in a statement. The National Policy Institute, a think tank within the so-called alt-right movement, which includes neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites, held a gathering at the federally owned Ronald Reagan Building last Saturday. A video by The Atlantic taken inside the conference showed Spencer shouting, \"Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!\" as some of the people in attendance lifted their arms in a Nazi salute. The alt-right movement came to the fore during the U.S. presidential election. President-elect Donald Trump has drawn criticism for naming Steve Bannon, former head of Breitbart News, a website linked to the alt-right, as his chief White House strategist.

Munir Abdulkader, 22, from the Cincinnati suburb of West Chester, had pleaded guilty on March 24 to attempted murder of a government employee, attempted material support of a foreign terrorist organization and illegal firearm possession. U.S. District Judge Michael Barrett in Cincinnati imposed the prison term, and ordered that Abdulkader remain under supervision for life. Prosecutors had sought a 25-year prison term. A federal public defender representing Abdulkader did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Abdulkader, who became a U.S. citizen in 2006 and had been a student at Xavier University, had begun by July 2014 expressing support for the Islamic State on Twitter, including a desire for martyrdom, according to prosecutors. The defendant also communicated electronically with Junaid Hussain, an Islamic State member who encouraged him to conduct a violent attack in the United States, prosecutors said. Hussain was a British hacker who U.S. and European officials had regarded as a top computer expert for Islamic State in Syria and a supporter of \"lone wolf\" attacks, before he was killed in an August 2015 U.S. drone strike. Prosecutors said Abdulkader planned to murder the military official at home, videotape the killing so it could be used in Islamic State propaganda, and then use firearms and Molotov cocktails to attack a police station in the Cincinnati area. Abdulkader was arrested on May 21, 2015, the same day he acquired an AK-47 assault rifle, court papers show. The case is U.S. v.

       " {'text': 'DETROIT The U.S. Transportation Department on Wednesday issued voluntary guidelines for makers of mobile devices, asking them to help keep eyes on the road by developing a \"driver mode\" that would disable some distracting functions in moving cars. The guidelines also ask manufacturers to make it easy to pair mobile devices with in-vehicle systems to facilitate hands-free phone use. \"These common sense guidelines, grounded in the best research available, will help designers of mobile devices build products that cut down on distraction on the road,\" U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in a press statement. Mark Rosekind, administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said in statement on Wednesday that driver distraction was one of the factors behind the rise of traffic fatalities. Road deaths rose 10.4 percent in the first half of 2016, NHTSA has said. Phone calls, text messages, navigation systems and other features on cellphones can be dangerous distractions for drivers and the Transportation Department and NHTSA want to limit their functionality when the devices are in what is termed \"driver mode.\" The Transportation Department also called for ease in pairing, which connects smart phones and cars to allow drivers to use voice control on the devices. Phone and vehicle pairing already are available for many new vehicles sold in the United States. Both the pairing and driver mode will reduce the potential for distraction by limiting the time a driver\\'s eyes are off the road, while also preserving the full functionality of the devices when used at other times. Major manufacturers of mobile devices used by American drivers include Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics. An auto manufacturers trade group earlier this month urged President-elect Donald Trump to establish a presidential advisory committee to \"coordinate auto sector regulators.\" The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers also called on Trump to conduct a \"comprehensive regulatory review\" of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration\\'s new guidance on self-driving vehicles.',\n",

Mr Trump, who takes office in January, said he hoped Cubans could move towards a freer future. Castro came to power in 1959 and ushered in a Communist revolution. He defied the US for decades, surviving many assassination plots. Supporters said he returned Cuba to the people. Critics called him a dictator. His brother Raul, who succeeded him as president, announced his death on state television on Friday night.

Under Barack Obama, the relationship warmed and diplomatic ties were restored in 2015. Mr Trump roundly criticised Mr Obama\\'s policy on the campaign trail but made no mention of his pledge to reverse it in his statement, saying his administration would do all it could to ensure Cubans could \"begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty\".

Drug abuse in Canada claimed the lives of 2,000 people in 2015.

Police Chief Adam Palmer also called for more help for the city\\'s addicts. \"Can you imagine nine people dying from another cause in one day in our city?\" he said. Vancouver has seen an average of 15 drug overdoses a month, with dozens more deaths still under investigation, Mr Palmer said. The city\\'s coroner said that morgues had reached capacity. Most of the deaths occurred in the Downtown Eastside neighbourhood, where drugs can be easily bought, Mr Palmer said. Two milligrams of pure fentanyl, the size of about four grains of salt, is enough to kill an average adult. In April, the US singer Prince died of an accidental overdose of the dangerously powerful synthetic drug. What is fentanyl? Fentanyl is an extremely strong painkiller, prescribed for severe chronic pain, or breakthrough pain which doesn\\'t respond to regular painkillers. It is an opioid painkiller which means it works by mimicking the body\\'s natural painkillers, called endorphins, which block pain messages to the brain. It can cause dangerous side effects, including severe breathing problems. The risk of harm is higher if the wrong dose or strength is used.',\n",

London City airport diverted all inbound flights on Saturday while Heathrow and Gatwick also reported disruption. Passengers were told to expect delays and to contact their airline before travelling to the airport.

The poor visibility in south-east England caused at least a dozen British Airways flights to be cancelled. \"In common with other airlines, we are experiencing some disruption to our flights,\" a BA spokesperson said. BA warned that there would be knock-on delays due to disruption at Heathrow. It said to expect delays and a \"small number\" of cancellations, as the airport has restricted landing and take-off.

He left a rucksack with explosives which failed to detonate in November, and put another explosive device by the town hall a few days later, they say. But a member of the public alerted the police, and no-one was injured. The 12 year old - who is now in custody - is thought have been recently radicalised and to have links with the so-called Islamic State group. Focus magazine cited security and judicial sources as saying the boy was \"strongly radicalised\" and apparently instructed by an unknown IS member. The Federal Public Prosecutor\\'s Office declined to comment on a possible IS link, but confirmed officials were investigating the case. Public Prosecutor Hubert Stroeber said the boy left a backpack containing a home-made nail bomb at the Christmas market in Ludwigshafen, in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, on 26 November, but the device did not go off because the detonator apparently failed. The second device near the city\\'s town hall, placed on 5 December, was discovered by an \"informant\" and specialists defused it, Mr Stroeber said. The boy was born in Ludwigshafen to Iraqi parents in 2004. Prosecutors said no formal proceedings would be launched against him, because he is below the age of criminal responsibility. Last Thursday, German police arrested two teenagers aged 15 and 17, accused of plotting a terror attack on a public institution in Aschaffenburg, in north-western Bavaria. Police found Islamic State flags and propaganda material in their homes. Germany suffered a spate of attacks in the south of the country over the summer.

He said in an earlier statement that the arrests were \"the result of excellent co-operation\" with Spanish authorities and \"a new blow to Eta\". The Spanish government has refused to negotiate with Eta. In 2014 the group said it had put some of its weapons \"beyond use\" but the government dismissed the statement as \"theatrical\".

But after the meetings, Mr. Gentz decided China\\'s approach to online fashion was far ahead of anything available elsewhere. He marveled at how Chinese consumers freely chatted with - and bought from - brands and stylists on WeChat, a local internet messenger, while online retailers, independent delivery companies and fashion houses routinely joined forces. \"We wanted to take that experience back to Europe,\" Mr. Gentz said. This holiday season, Zalando, which is Europe\\'s biggest digital fashion player, is using a made-in-China approach to take on Amazon, just as the American giant is looking to cement its place as the world\\'s dominant e-commerce company by expanding aggressively into the Continent\\'s still-fragmented world of digital fashion.',\n",

Following the end of its merged agreement with football\\'s governing body FIFA, the 2016 Ballon d\\'Or award -- now run solely by its founder France Football magazine -- was decided by a vote of 173 journalists for the 30 nominated players. In 2010-15, it also featured votes from national team captains and managers. FIFA will award its own prize for the world\\'s top performing player -- with Ronaldo, Messi and Atletico Madrid striker Antoine Griezmann shortlisted -- in a ceremony due to be held on January 9 in Zurich, Switzerland. Griezmann, who was top scorer at Euro 2016 with six goals for losing finalist France, was third behind Messi in the Ballon d\\'Or voting. Messi\\'s Barca clubmates Luis Suarez and Neymar were fourth and fifth respectively ahead of Real\\'s Gareth Bale, a semifinalist at Euro 2016 with Wales. Ronaldo\\'s success was foreshadowed late Sunday when an image purporting to show a leaked front cover of the latest edition of France Football -- declaring him the winner -- appeared on social media late Sunday. Ronaldo first won the coveted prize in 2008, doing so again in 2013 and 2014. He and Messi have been the only winners since Brazil\\'s Kaka took the honor in 2007.',\n",

The new advancement in in vitro fertilization, developed by doctors in Newcastle, is intended to prevent children being born with certain fatal genetic diseases. Mitochondria have their own DNA, which controls only mitochondrial function and energy production. This is separate from our \"nuclear DNA,\" which makes us who we are and determines appearance and personality. Known as \"mitochondrial donation,\" the IVF technique involves replacing faulty mitochondria inherited from the mother with the healthy mitochondria of another woman. Most of a cell\\'s genetic material, or DNA, is contained within the nucleus, but a very small amount (less than 1%) is found in the mitochondria. This mitochondrial DNA is inherited only from the mother through her eggs. If the mother\\'s mitochondrial DNA is faulty, it is possible that she may pass on a number of rare but very serious mitochondrial diseases, including muscle weakness, diabetes, heart problems, epilepsy and stroke-like episodes. In serious cases, they can lead to death.

On top of that, the provincial ministers argue that Ottawa\\'s latest offer would likely leave provincial health budgets in an even worse financial situation than if the Liberals allow health transfers to fall, as planned, and proceed with what they had promised in their 2015 campaign platform. Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau said late Sunday that he hoped the provinces would have an open mind heading into the discussions. Provincial and territorial finance ministers were expected to turn up the pressure when they sat down for a working dinner Sunday with Morneau. Talks were to continue Monday and health ministers from across the country were expected to join in during a special afternoon session. Morneau has said he\\'s \"cautiously optimistic\" that an agreement could be reached and, on his way into Sunday\\'s dinner, he told reporters that Ottawa planned to put forward an important idea focused on mental health and home care. The two sides, however, appeared to be far apart late Sunday. \\'We\\'re not satisfied\\' \"I can talk for everyone across the country - we\\'re not satisfied with the way things are conducted,\" Quebec Health Minister Gaetan Barrette said Sunday in an interview. \"There\\'s been no negotiations whatsoever during the last year and we are being served an ultimatum by Bill Morneau, which is totally insulting and inappropriate... \"Unless he proposes something better than what he put on the table, things are going to be very bad tomorrow.\" Even as provincial finance ministers started travelling to the capital Sunday to push for more federal support, the Trudeau government showed no signs it was prepared to budge on its plan to clamp down on increases to health-transfer payments. The federal Finance Department released figures Sunday showing that the Liberals were banking on just a three per cent increase in health care funding in 2017-18, far below what provinces and territories are requesting. In all, the numbers revealed that Ottawa intended to provide $37.15 billion next year in health transfers, up from the almost $36.',\n",

Walsh had hoped a living donor might come forward, but that prospect dimmed when someone who was a match backed out, after demanding financial compensation. \"I can barely rest,\" said Walsh, who looks like a shell of the tall, husky man he was - until last December when he got sick. \"My bones rub together when I sleep,\" he told CBC Toronto. Walsh has Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH), a condition where fatty deposits inside the liver become inflamed, causing the organ to scar and enlarge. NASH is a more severe form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and can develop, as with Walsh\\'s case, into cirrhosis. By Stage 4, the damage is irreversible. Walsh\\'s liver is operating at 20 per cent. A brush with death Every two weeks Walsh goes to Trillium Health Centre in Mississauga to have a catheter stuck into his distended, water-filled abdomen to drain the fluids. It has to be done carefully, so his bowel and other organs won\\'t be punctured. \"My abdomen just started swelling to the point where it looked like I was nine months pregnant,\" Walsh said as he described the first time he landed in the emergency room last December. \"The doctors drained 15 litres from my abdomen.\" It\\'s a routine he\\'ll undergo biweekly until he dies or he gets a new liver. The husband and father of four has been preparing for death since that day in December. A brush with extortion Walsh went through seven months of these painful drainage treatments before being put on the organ donor list. It was a glimmer of hope that quickly dimmed. \"It became readily apparent there were just not enough donors in the deceased donor bank,\" he said Walsh\\'s family and friends volunteered to go through the screening process for becoming living donors.

A few weeks earlier, Pallister had told the Winnipeg Free Press that he had not been in Costa Rica in early 2016 when in fact he had been.

Carfentanil is the most toxic form of synthetic opioid. Authorities believe it\\'s being manufactured in clandestine labs in Asia and smuggled to Canada in small packages. At St. Paul\\'s Hospital in downtown Vancouver, the doctors and nurses who treat a constant stream of overdose patients believe they\\'re seeing the drug\\'s dangerous effects up close. Dr. Kevin Nemethy says a single dose of opioid antidote naloxone (brand name Narcan) used to be enough to wake up an overdose patient. \"Now we are not finding the desired effect until we give 10 times the dose or even 20 times the dose of naloxone,\" he told CBC News during a particularly busy shift on Nov. 24 - the day after the last provincial social assistance cheques were issued. Tanya Campbell, the emergency department\\'s nurse leader, says the number of overdoses is overwhelming and the patients appear to be taking stronger drugs. \"We actually start them on a continuous drip of Narcan, if they are not waking up,\" she said. \"Sometimes we have to take over their airway till they get the drugs out of their system and they wake up.\" B.C. lab can\\'t test for carfentanil She says she believes some patients get tricked into buying opioids like carfentanil when they think they\\'re buying heroin. Vancouver police have confirmed they\\'ve seized drugs containing carfentanil. But the province\\'s coroner has yet to confirm how many of the 755 overdose deaths in B.C. so far this year are linked to the drug because its toxicology centre can\\'t test for it. The Provincial Health Services Authority says the lab received the necessary licence last week, but equipment needs to be calibrated and testing for carfentanil won\\'t start for two to three months. Alberta\\'s lab is already equipped and has linked the drug to 15 deaths. Nurse Campbell fears naloxone will soon be no match for carfentanil. \"I think that\\'s a fear that all of us have as',\n",

David Leslie Hickson, 34, admitted fatally stabbing New Zealand national Campbell Paterson at a house in Edmonton, south of Cairns, in November 2014. However, Hickson had pleaded not guilty to murder, saying he acted in self-defence. Hickson, who pleaded guilty to interfering with a corpse, chopped up Paterson\\'s body and put his torso into a 40-litre esky before dumping it near Yarrabah, near Cairns. It took the jury just under two hours to reach a verdict. There were cheers from Mr Paterson\\'s family as the verdict was read out in court this morning. Members of Mr Paterson\\'s family also wept as victim impact statements were read out. This afternoon, Justice Jim Henry sentenced Hickson to life in jail, describing the crime as \"despicable\". \"You moved in the murky world of drug consumption and drug dealing and enforcing drug debts - there is no honour in those who move in that world,\" Justice Henry said. \"You had all been taking [the drug] ice in the lead up to these events. \"This case is another example of how this drug causes increased paranoia and aggression. \"It is rightly described as a dangerous drug - it is not only dangerous for those who use it, but those who come in contact with users, who sometimes suffer inexplicable violence at the user\\'s hands.\" Hickson was also sentenced to 20 months in jail for interfering with a corpse, and more than a year for almost a dozen other summary offences, including assault and drug charges. Justine Henry described Hickson cutting off Mr Paterson\\'s legs as \"vile misconduct\". \"That act of depravity constitutes a despicable indignity done to the dead body of another,\" he said. The victim\\'s sister, Kataraina Paterson, who travelled from New Zealand to attend the trial, spoke outside the court. \"Hearing the details were just awful - we are just grateful we have a guilty verdict. \"Hickson deserves to go to jail for life. \"We will heal a lot hearing this guilty verdict, although it won\\'t bring him [',\n",

Canada now must find other ways to stitch together opportunities for the western provinces in the Pacific. In this context, the just completed major trade mission to China by the Government of Alberta takes on even greater importance in securing the province\\'s future export growth. China is Canada\\'s second largest trading partner, after the U.S. Although the province has seen a slower growth in Asian economies in 2016, growth is projected to gradually rebound to an average of 6.2 per cent a year (2016 - 2020). Canada currently has only one trade agreement in Asia. The TPP would have given Canadian companies seven new agreements. Further, it would have closed the gap with our major competitors in Asia - including Australia and New Zealand, which have more than a dozen trade agreements each, and Chile, which produces many of the same commodities as we do in the West and has nine agreements. Trade agreements level the playing field and give companies an opportunity to compete for markets on an equal footing with their competitors. But they also give advantages that companies from countries with agreements can use to keep competitors out or make entry costlier and more difficult. That is the uphill climb facing Canadian companies in Asia today - struggling to climb the hill while their competitors ride the \"trade agreement gondola\" to the top. In the fallout from the TPP, Ottawa will have to pursue a slower, more difficult bilateral approach, negotiating deals one by one, country by country. Meanwhile, Canada will need to find other ways to open markets, raise awareness and fill in the gaps left behind by unsigned trade agreements. In Alberta, that means the province must increase its outreach to Asia, including more advocacy and education at home and abroad. These kinds of investments are key, even if their returns aren\\'t immediately obvious. You can\\'t move goods to markets without roads, and you can\\'t access those markets without the soft infrastructure of connections, good will and strong brand. The Government of Alberta just completed missions to China and Japan, connecting with buyers and investors and promoting Alberta industries including softwood lumber, agri-food, tourism and technology in an effort to tap into the regions\\' powerful - and growing - middle class.

The plan includes introducing a tax of $20 per tonne of carbon Jan. 1, ending coal-fired electrical generation by 2030 and phasing in renewable energy sources. Phillips had said the town halls will give Albertans an opportunity to learn more about the details of the strategy. One Edmonton resident who called in questioned how the carbon levy would help businesses struggling due to low oil and gas prices. \"We are barely hanging on and now we have these taxes,\" he said. \"Can this energy plan be pushed off until Alberta is officially out of a recession?\" More than 1,000 people gathered Sunday at a Calgary rally to demand the NDP scrap its carbon tax. The event had been organized by Ezra Levant\\'s Rebel Media and drew people who had lost jobs in the oil and gas industry. The NDP has said carbon rebates will offset the levy for low- and middle-income families. Households earning up to $95,000 will be eligible for a full rebate, Phillips said. \"Alberta is the only place in North America that doesn\\'t have any energy efficiency programming,\" she said. \"We have really tried to focus on more practical energy efficiencies ... things like insulation ... light bulbs, low-flow shower heads ... not everyone can buy a brand-new car.\" Phillips also touted the recent approval of two major pipeline projects. \"Those pipeline approvals will lead to 22,000 new jobs,\" she said, adding that the government plans to invest in renewable energy and clean technology.

It also recommended storefront and mail-order sales to Canadians over the age of 18 and personal growing limits of four plants per person. \"We have discovered that regulation of cannabis will touch every aspect of our society,\" said the 106-page report. The task force, headed by former federal Liberal cabinet minister Anne McLellan of Edmonton, said production should be monitored with a \"seed-to-sale tracking system\" to prevent diversions to the black market. \"Our advice includes safeguards that we believe are important to attain the objectives set out by the government to better protect the health and safety of Canadians by regulating access to cannabis,\" McLellan told a news conference in Ottawa. Martinez said provinces should be afforded the autonomy to regulate marijuana sales. \"We at least want to be considered ... when we are already selling a controlled substance in Alberta,\" she said, adding the task force made the connection that selling alcohol and cannabis together would encourage the use of both. \"We can\\'t control what consumers are going to do, but we can control that recreational marijuana is sold in a responsible and safe manner.\" She said separate entrances to stores or separate facilities may be necessary, but liquor stores should be involved in the sales. \"We\\'re uniquely qualified to do this,\" she said. \"Hopefully, we can work with government to help operators understand how to sell it and how to advise consumers.\"',\n",

Alberta\\'s capital city sits in eighth place out of 10 Canadian cities for its socio-economic and physical health, according to a report released Tuesday morning. The Conference Board of Canada\\'s first-ever City Health Monitor report measures each city\\'s performance based on 24 indicators, grouped into four categories: The new ranking compares Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Saskatoon, Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Quebec City and Halifax. Letter grades were assigned to assess each city\\'s performance. Saskatoon, Calgary and Winnipeg each earn an \"A\" grade. Montreal finished in 10th place and is the only city to receive an overall grade of \"D.\" The remaining cities, including Edmonton, earned a \"B\" grade. Although the standard of living within Canada\\'s largest cities is similar, slight variations can have a major impact on the population, said Louis Theriault, vice president of Public Policy at the Conference Board of Canada. \"Overall Edmonton received a B ranking,\" Theriault said. \"It\\'s not as low as the ranking seems to suggest. That said, there are definitely some areas that deserve specific attention.\" Edmonton given \\'B\\' grade Although Edmonton\\'s economy remains healthy, the city faltered in other categories, Theriault said. The overall physical health of the population put Edmonton near the bottom of the list of Canadian cities. Edmonton was the only city to earn a \\'D\\' ranking in this category. \"What stands out is when you look at population health, stroke and cancer, for whatever reason, is quite high in Edmonton compared to other cities,\" Theriault said in an interview with CBC Radio\\'s Edmonton AM. \"When you look at more details around lifestyle, it\\'s probably not the whole story, but there are some issues around smoking, for example, that could be improved.\" Edmonton also finished near the bottom of the rankings for \"healthy lifestyle\" with elevated rates of smoking, obesity, a general lack of physical exercise and a failure to regularly eat fruit and vegetables. \"It\\'s good in terms of healthcare access and how people feel about life but there is definitely room for improvement in terms of health outcomes and prevention strategies,\" Theriault said. \"It\\'s hard to draw causalities, but it\\'s really a full picture on where Edmonton can improve.\" In looking',\n",

Officers say in the last three months, 95 children have been charged with more than 450 crimes ranging from assault, to breaking into homes and stealing cars. For the residents of Edmonton, just outside Cairns, the past three months have been difficult. The head of the Traders Association and petrol station owner, Phillip Ungerer, says there is a constant problem with children out at night, breaking the law. \"It was absolutely hell out here. There was a gang of probably about 15 to 16-year-olds. They vandalised a number of businesses out here in Edmonton, graffitied everything that wasn\\'t walking,\" he said. He says the children are local to the area. \"I actually feel sorry for these kids. I mean at such a tender age in their lives, they\\'re going nowhere,\" he said. The head of the Cairns child protection and investigation unit, Detective Senior Sergeant Glen Horan, agrees offences committed by children in Far North Queensland are a major problem. In the past two years he has seen a leap in the level of youth crime in the area and he knows who is offending. \"Statistically between 10 and 19 [years old] is the larger group of young offenders, and about 85 per cent of those young offenders are male and identify as Indigenous,\" he said. \"So offenders are predominantly male, though we do have some, a small group of female offenders as well who commit similar type offences.\" Targeting young offenders Since 2010 the Cairns police force has been running a specialised operation to target this rise in youth crime. Detective Senior Sergeant Horan says these children are, for the most part, breaking into homes, assaulting people and stealing cars. \"Most of the crimes committed by young people aren\\'t particularly sophisticated,\" he said. Since July this year the Cairns juvenile justice unit has charged 95 children with more than 450 offences. Detective Senior Sergeant Horan says in one case five boys amassed 150 charges in just three months. But he says while those figures seem high, it is not that alarming to police. \"Across a year, there\\'s normally only a core group of offenders, so although we talk about upwards of 500 offences for the year, we would find that there\\'s',\n",

Seven men were convicted over the brawl that took place on a deserted street in Upper Edmonton on 25 February last year. Two groups of young men can be seen confronting each other with weapons to settle a disagreement over money. Hayder Bozkina, 20, accompanied by Bartek Glowacki, 21, confronted Rekan Saver, 20, before blows were exchanged with a group of men supporting Saver. As Bozkina and Glowacki threaten the group, they eventually try to flee in their car, which causes the large group to attack the vehicle. The group smash the car windows and attack the pair within the vehicle as it tries to get away, smashing into other vehicles parked on the street. Bozkina and Glowacki were jailed for affray and possession of an offensive weapon, while Saver was imprisoned for affray and possession of an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence. Other participants included Mohamed Abdi, 21, who was detained under the Mental Health Act after appearing at Wood Green Crown Court charged with affray. Meanwhile, Mahir Kilic, 27, and Mahmood Abubakr, 18, were sentenced for affray. Detective Constable Rob Jones said: \"CCTV footage shows that all those convicted armed themselves with weapons during this confrontation. \"The level of violence used was excessive and it is only by sheer luck that no person died as a result. \"All six males showed a complete disregard for the safety of themselves and anyone else who may have been passing by as they fought. \"Violence of this nature will not be tolerated by police - we will identify, arrest and put before the courts those who choose to take this path.\"',\n",

The pupils aged nine and ten from St Edmund\\'s Catholic Primary School in Hertford Road, Edmonton are members of the school\\'s gardening club. The children dug flower beds, planted flowers, and landscaped the Crescent Conservation Area, in Hertford Road, close to their school, to make it a nice place for the wider community. The final design was shaped by the people of Edmonton during a public consultation which took place in summer. The project to improve the Crescent includes a new footpath, a central paved area, an arc of shaped trees and flowerbeds containing perennial flowers that provide a dash of colour all year round. The project is designed to sustainably manage rainwater by allowing it to run off into the flowerbeds. The flowers have been specially chosen to encourage bees and butterflies to visit the area. Head teacher, Margaret Hanley, said: \"Our pupils have enjoyed taking responsibility for planting an area they use on their way to and from school. It has helped them to demonstrate good skills of citizenship, serving their community through their hard work. \"And it was great fun!\" Enfield Council\\'s cabinet member for education, children\\'s services and protection, Ayfer Orhan, said: \"This is a brilliant project, which has allowed the children to participate in a scheme that benefits the wider community. \"Every time they visit The Crescent they will be reminded how their efforts have made a genuine difference to the community and they should have an immense sense of pride and achievement in what they have done. \"They are a credit to the borough and we are very grateful for their hard work and endeavour.\"',\n",

It is one of seven churches in Enfield operating a shelter that will run for thirteen weeks from January 4. Parishioner and one of the two co-ordinators, David Bayton, said: \"Last year was the first year we did it here and it was a real eye-opener. \"People were apprehensive about what it would involve. \"You tend to think the guests will be men in rags, who have drink problems, but they are people like you and me who have fallen on hard times, for whatever reason. \"We all became really close and by the end of the three months it was quite upsetting when it all came to an end.\" Rough sleepers have the option of going to a Crisis charity centre at Christmas, so the winter night shelter, in Church Street, begins in January, when many are back on the streets again. Guests are referred by outside agencies - they can\\'t just turn up at the door - and must be drug and drink free when they are there. The men and women are given a home cooked evening meal and then chat with volunteers before turning in for the night on inflatable beds with clean sheets. The next morning there\\'s breakfast - luxuries they don\\'t get sleeping on the streets. Fellow co-ordinator, Anne Marie Sanderson said: \"There\\'s so much stigma involved with homeless people. But a lot of the people here last year had jobs and were really struggling to survive after being kicked out of their private rented accommodation. \"It makes you realise, it really can happen to anybody at any time. \"I have a support network and could move in with family or friends if I lost my house, but a lot of people don\\'t have that support.\" Guests are encouraged to save half their income, if they have jobs, while staying at the shelter and are helped by the Pilion Trust, an anti-poverty charity that tries to break the cycle and get them back on their feet.

Think of it - this country has the brightest star in swimming in Oleksiak, the next great sprinter in Andre De Grasse and the defining hockey player of his generation in Sidney Crosby. But there is also a top-10 golfer in Brooke Henderson, third-ranked tennis player Milos Raonic and the Olympic high jump champion in Derek Drouin, who won gold with a stress fracture in his back. Add Olympic gold-medallists Erica Wiebe (wrestling) and Rosie MacLennan (trampoline) as well as dominant para-swimmer Aurelie Rivard, who won three gold medals in Rio de Janeiro and set world records along the way.

Evan Dunfee, the Olympic race walker, merits a mention not only for his outstanding performance, but his steadfast adherence to the sanctity of honest and honourable competition. There are just too many to mention. Canadian athletes have demonstrated incredible prowess this year and for the selectors it was a difficult choice. Never, in my experience on the panel of voters for this award, has there been more to choose from. It is proof positive that Canada is a sporting nation rich in a diversity of endeavour and talent. In the end, there should be no dissent with regard to the recipient of this year's Lou Marsh Award. Oleksiak is a strong female athlete who won four medals at the Olympic Games and became the Olympic champion in Olympic record time. It is something never done before by any Canadian athlete at a single summer edition of the Games. She also captured four medals at the recent world short-course championships. Along the way, at the Olympic trials, at the Games themselves, and at the world championships, Oleksiak set 11 Canadian records, three world junior records and an Olympic record.

During a news conference on Tuesday the group of 15 mayors all mentioned needless waiting, wasting gas and higher air pollution as reasons to allow right turns on red lights. Turning right on red lights became legal in Quebec in 2003, after a pilot project. At the time, the island of Montreal cited security and safety concerns for not joining the pilot project. \"We need to keep in mind that the island of Montreal, along with New York City, is the only region in Canada and the United States where it is prohibited to make a right turn on red,\" Beaconsfield Mayor Georges Bourelle told reporters. The mayors cited a CROP poll that found 73 per cent of Montreal residents and 71 per cent of demerged city residents were in favour of turning right on red. They also pointed to Ministry of Transportation numbers that show, in 2015, there were 361 road fatalities compared to 2,200 road fatalities in 1973. Bourelle, Mount Royal Mayor Philippe Roy and Montreal East Mayor Robert Coutu all agreed that certain traffic lights should remain off limits, particularly some in downtown Montreal, but that more than half of the 2,587 traffic lights would be suitable for the change. \"In all other parts of Quebec, for 13 years, Ministry of Transportation statistics prove that Quebecers behave in exactly the same way as motorists everywhere else,\" said Bourelle. The City of Montreal recently adopted a Swedish road model policy, \"Vision Zero,\" to help eliminate fatalities and serious injuries due to traffic collisions. Part of the policy calls for not allowing right on red as a way to protect the most vulnerable. \"I think that we have to learn to live together before even thinking about doing that because we have some relationship and coexistence issues between pedestrians and drivers, bikes and trucks,\" said Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre in a previous interview with CTV News. Coderre also said, due to the requirement that cars leave a five-metre margin at intersections, to allow pedestrians to cross the street safely, allowing right on red \"won\\'t happen.\"',\n",

The agreement was not reached by consent but was signed last week by the Boons and the B.C. government. \"We were not able to come to a consensual agreement with the Boons and so we have acquired their property through expropriation,\" said McDonald at a Site C project briefing with reporters. \"We have agreed with the Boons that they will remain in their home until the end of May and that they will have the rights and ability to continue farming the land for an additional two year period of time.\" Site C will flood more than 5,500 hectares of land along the Peace River, creating an 83-kilometre-long reservoir and provide enough power to light up 400,000 homes. Project construction started in the summer of 2015 and is scheduled for completion in 2024. The Boons are long-time farmers in northeastern B.C. and have fought the project in court. They could not be reached for comment. An online petition to stop the dam includes photos of the Boons on their property. Arlene Boon states in the petition that their farmhouse was built by her grandfather and \"Hydro\\'s plan is to flood our property and destroy it.\" McDonald said the value of the Boon expropriation agreement will be subject to negotiations over the next year. \"It sets out that they have committed they won\\'t physically interfere with the project in any way, not just on their lands,\" said McDonald. Hydro recently reached consensual property agreements with six other landowners in the area to make room for the highway project.

       " {'text': 'BEIRUT - A cease-fire to evacuate rebel fighters and civilians from the remaining opposition-held neighborhoods of Aleppo unraveled on Wednesday, once again raising the specter of a bloody end to the battle for Syria\\'s largest city as residents reported the resumption of shelling and brutal bombing runs. Opponents of President Bashar Assad accused the government and its allies of scuttling the deal by adding new conditions, including the lifting of a rebel siege on two pro-government Shiite villages in nearby Idlib province. However, hours after it crumbled, the rebels said the deal was back on. There was no comment from the government or its allies, and minutes after the new cease-fire was to take effect at 11:30 p.m. local time, there were still reports of shelling in the few blocks of the city under rebel control. Three rebel spokesmen said the first group of wounded people and civilians were to be escorted out of the city early Thursday morning. Rebels would follow, they said, adding that the conditions had not changed and that they had even agreed with the Russians on the exact number of buses and convoys to be deployed in the rescue. The Syrian military media denied an agreement had been reached and said in a statement that the negotiations were \"complicated.\" The evacuation was to have begun at dawn Wednesday, but quickly derailed, descending into terrifying violence. Residents said government buses arrived in the pre-dawn hours at agreed upon meeting points, where the wounded were first in line to be evacuated after surviving weeks of intense fighting amid destroyed medical facilities and depleted supplies. But they were turned away by pro-government militias manning the checkpoints. Then violence erupted: shelling and then airstrikes. The rebels retaliated, at one point shelling the pro-government villages of Foua and Kfraya in Idlib and detonating a car bomb in a frontline area. Residents, activists and medical staff described mayhem in the tiny sliver of Aleppo still under opposition control as volleys of shells rained down on the area where tens of thousands of civilians were trapped alongside rebels in gutted apartment buildings and other shelters. Videos shared online by residents huddling indoors recorded the sounds of war - deafening explosions that highlighted fears of a bloodbath',\n",

       " {'text': 'London\\'s entrenched crystal meth crisis has prompted the city\\'s homeless coalition to launch a campaign next year educating the public, agencies and the government about the devastating drug. \"We want to help the general public understand we are in a crystal meth crisis and it has a huge impact on the individuals, on the services and on the general well-being of the community,\" said Abe Oudshoorn, outgoing chair of the London Homeless Coalition. \"Not to oversimplify, but we can almost blame the one substance for how things feel in our city.\" The coalition is a collection of agencies and advocates involved with homelessness. Each year it sets priorities. Crystal methamphetamine addiction began taking hold in London about two years ago, presenting a startlingly different face to addiction than other opioids. Opioids are depressants that slow a person\\'s system. Crystal meth is a stimulant that speeds up the body\\'s central nervous system and over time causes violence, delusions, paranoia and hallucinations. London\\'s homelessness programs are working, evident in a decrease in shelter visits and increase in people getting housing, Oudshoorn said. But the perception in the public might be different, he said. \"When people talk about how downtown feels worse or places don\\'t feel safe, we want to help people to clearly understand that is the impact of one substance.\" The coalition wants to push the province to raise social assistance rates to help people find proper housing, Oudshoorn said. Without access to proper housing, people are forced into unsafe and unhealthy housing that affects mental health and can encourage addictions, he said. \"It is such a fundamental gap between moving people from homelessness to housing, the financial side. There will be a call to raise the rates.\" Social service agencies have already had to change how they handle people addicted to crystal meth compared to people addicted to opioids, Oudshoorn noted. City agencies that are part of the coalition are working on a drug plan for London, but will help share information while that plan is developed, Oudshoorn said. In London, advocates say crystal meth use is much higher than the use of fentanyl and its toxic and more powerful variant known as carfentanil',\n",

When someone is struggling with their business and needs some advice, people often say, \"Oh, do you know Nick? You should really talk to Nick.\" Burton, 39, runs Blue Collar Paris Victory Gardens in Paris, Texas, where he grows vegetables hydroponically and in soil. It used to be a nursery but now functions as the source of his subscription-based salad delivery business, Victory Lunch Club. A New Mexico native, Burton moved to Texas in 2001. He started a lawn and landscaping business and grew from there. The \"self-development junkie\" said he became addicted to business coaching, which ranges from speaker training to technical expertise to image consulting. \"Whenever I got outside coaching, that\\'s when my business took off,\" he said. \"And whenever I couldn\\'t afford it was when I needed it most.\" Now, Burton\\'s the coach. Earlier this year, he launched another business, a passion project called State of the Soil. The series of virtual seminars is designed to educate farmers on business and marketing tactics. Recordings of the webinars are available any time online for a fee, but live webinars are available for free a few times per year. As a farmer, Burton feels obligated to pass along where he has made mistakes and to give back to the agricultural community. \"Farmers are not used to having to pay for training because of the USDA and other programs,\" Burton said. \"But with that, they are not getting great education, especially when it comes to the business side of things.\" Farming, by nature, can be a solitary career choice -- and a calling for many -- that\\'s full of trial and error and a lot of learning the hard way. Farmers are not used to networking or asking for help, and they\\'re driven more by pride in their work than by market demands. \"I want to give people permission to tell their story, and sometimes, I have to give people permission to make a profit,\" Burton said. \"But a lot of these are small family farms, and if they don\\'t succeed, they are going to lose it',\n",

It was an attack,\" Dr. Maggard described. Her husband, John Finney said, \"He started shooting bullets in the air, and police were in the street. It was a very terrifying moment.\" The couple\\'s daughter, Maranda Finney, is in school at Georgetown College. Finney says at first her parents weren\\'t able to provide a lot of details about what was going on, only that they were alive and ok. She spent the next few hours searching online, trying to find any information she could. \"You don\\'t think it\\'s going to happen to you,\" Finney said. \"I was like it\\'s not going to happen to us. I know it\\'s happened before and everyone thinks that it\\'s not gonna happen. I still can\\'t even fathom.\" Finney says she would have been on that trip if not for finals coming up at Georgetown. Finney\\'s parents and siblings are visiting other cities in Europe as well. They had plans to leave Paris on Saturday. The will return to Kentucky next week.',\n",

       " {'text': 'PARIS, Mo. - In 1999, Lynn and Bob Fodge were looking to move their farming operation from Indiana, where both were born and raised. Their oldest son was interested in raising cattle, and if the Fodges were going to expand their operation, they needed to relocate. \"Bobby, our oldest son, is a cattleman, has been since the day he was born,\" Lynn Fodge says. \"In Indiana, there just wasn\\'t room to expand there.\" The family considered locations across the massive middle swath of the country. \"We looked from mid-Ohio to the western borders of Montana and Wyoming,\" Fodge says. The family ended up picking a spot in Monroe County in northeast Missouri. In the last few years, Missouri has ranked second or third in number of beef cows, occasionally switching spots with Oklahoma and ranking only behind Texas. Fodge said Missouri had a lot to offer for them as a place to raise cattle. \"There was a big enough piece to do what we wanted,\" she says. \"... It\\'s good here. There is a lot of marginal ground here that until two years ago hadn\\'t been put into crops.\" Fodge says it\\'s competitive for pasture, but their forages and crops meet their needs. The family calls their farm Hopewell Farms, and they grow row crops and Angus beef cattle. They farm with Bobby and his wife, Patty, their younger son, Alec, and his wife, Annie. Some members of the family are more into cattle, and some are more into the row crops, but they all pitch in and help where it\\'s needed. Fodge says they are the fourth largest Angus breeder in Missouri, and on a recent early May day, black cattle dotted the lush green grass in the pastures fanning out from the farm office. The white boards on the wall helped keep track of who was coming to pick up cattle. Periodically, the phone rang with customers calling. They sell their Angus cattle to customers all over Missouri and out of state as well. Fodge enjoys working with these people, building relationships with the repeat customers. \"I suppose the interactions with our customers would be the thing that is the best for me,\" she says. As for the decision to relocate to Missouri, the Show-Me State offers a lot of benefits for beef',\n",

Brunson, a North Carolina native, has been detained in Turkey since October. \"Not only were we able to make the President and Vice President aware that this was a priority of ours, we were pleased that they shared our concern and acted upon it,\" said Moore, author of \"Defying ISIS: Preserving Christianity in the Place of Its Birth and in Your Own Backyard,\" in a statement to RNS.

A minister of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church, Brunson was originally detained in the coastal town of Izmir, where he had lived for two decades, and was later transferred to a prison. The American Center for Law and Justice, a conservative Christian law firm working for Brunson\\'s release, said he has been falsely charged with \"membership in an armed terrorist organization.\" The Turkish president reiterated Tuesday that he believes that organization, identified by Turkish media as a network of U.S.-based Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, was involved in the attempted coup. Gulen has rejected those claims. A Turkish Protestant official said there is no connection between Brunson and the organization, Slate reported. Jay Sekulow, chief counsel of the ACLJ, discussed Brunson\\'s case with Trump at a White House meeting days before the president\\'s meeting with Erdogan. He called the White House\\'s attention to the case \"a major sign of significant progress toward bringing Pastor Andrew home.\" The European Centre for Law and Justice, a partner of the ACLJ, previously petitioned the United Nations to intervene for the pastor, saying Turkey was violating its constitution and the U.N.

According to Conrad, South Africa increasingly spreads its volumes over more and more markets, and especially the Asian market is becoming larger for South Africa. For VerDi, the most important markets are the Netherlands, Scandinavia and Eastern and Southern Europe. \"The consumption of grapefruit remains stable in any case, and even appears to be recovering again somewhat.\"',\n",

       " {'text': 'The global energy shortage, which is particularly threatening to South Africa, makes it imperative to apply and operate the most energy-efficient smelter technology, says metallurgical plant and machine construction company SMS Siemag. Over the years, the group has developed several measures to reduce the overall energy consumption of metal and slag production lines. \"And, with ongoing innovation and adaptation, we are convinced that significant additional energy reduction can be achieved in the future,\" says SMS Siemag submerged-arc furnaces and electric smelters GM Rolf Degel. Submerged-arc furnaces and electric smelters form an essential part of the production line, especially in the ferro- alloy, silicon metal and non- ferrous metal processes. Most of these electric furnaces are highly energy intensive, with the metallurgical process consuming the bulk of electricity. Energy consumption is mainly determined by the smelting process implemented, and is also influenced by the design of the furnace, notes smelter design and construction company Metix MD Reinier Meyjes. SMS Siemag owns a majority share of Metix. The production of silicon metal and iron silicon requires the highest specific energy consumption. The electrical energy required to operate a sili- con metal furnace is between 11 000 kWh and 13 500 kWh. Meanwhile, iron-nickel units consume between 5 500 kWh and 8 000 kWh of energy for every ton of iron nickel produced, depending on the minerals and nickel content of the product. Energy Reduction Measures The measures the SMS group has developed to reduce the overall energy consumption of smelting technology include the application of energy recovery systems, such as the solution SMS Siemag installed for Turkey\\'s sole high-carbon ferrochrome producer, Eti Krom. \"In semiopen-type electric smelters, the combustible gas that is generated during the process is fully combusted in the freeboard below the furnace roof. The furnaces are equipped with adjustable doors, which allow precise control of the offgas temperature. Depending on the process, the temperature is controlled at between 550 °C and 750 °C,\" explains Degel. A boiler produces 30 t/h of superheated steam, which is converted into 5 MW of electrical power by a generator. Eti Krom calculated the amortisation period of the installation',\n",

       " {'text': 'WASHINGTON Christopher Steele, who wrote reports on compromising material Russian operatives allegedly had collected on U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, is a former officer in Britain\\'s Secret Intelligence Service, according to people familiar with his career. Former British intelligence officials said Steele spent years under diplomatic cover working for the agency, also known as MI6, in Russia and Paris and at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London. After he left the spy service, Steele supplied the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation with information on corruption at FIFA, international soccer\\'s governing body. It was his work on corruption in international soccer that lent credence to his reporting on Trump\\'s entanglements in Russia, U.S. officials said on Wednesday. Emails seen by Reuters indicate that, in the summer of 2010, members of a New York-based FBI squad assigned to investigate \"Eurasian Organized Crime\" met Steele in London to discuss allegations of possible corruption in FIFA, the Zurich, Switzerland-based body that also organizes the World Cup tournament. People familiar with Steele\\'s activities said his London-based company, Orbis Business Intelligence, was hired by the Football Association (FA), England\\'s domestic soccer governing body, to investigate FIFA. At the time, the FA was hoping to host the 2018 or 2022 World Cups. British corporate records show that Orbis was formed in March 2009. Amid a swirl of corruption allegations, the 2018 World Cup was awarded to Moscow and Qatar was chosen to host the 2022 competition. The FBI squad whose members met Steele subsequently opened a major investigation into alleged soccer corruption that led to dozens of U.S. indictments, including those of prominent international soccer officials. Senior FIFA officials, including long-time president Sepp Blatter, were forced to resign. SHIFTING GEARS Steele was initially hired by FusionGPS, a Washington-based political research firm, to investigate Trump on behalf of unidentified Republicans who wanted to stop Trump\\'s bid for the party\\'s nomination. The BBC said on Wednesday, \"He (Steele) was compiling this report on behalf of initially Trump\\'s opponent Jeb Bush,\" referring to one of Trump\\'s 16 opponents in the 2016 Republican primary. The BBC subsequently said on Thursday that its correspondent misspoke. Bush\\'s spokeswoman, Kristy Campbell, denied any involvement between Bush and Steele. \"It is absolutely',\n",

The landslide hit the village of Xinmo at around 6 am (2200 GMT Friday) and blocked a 2-kilometre section of a river, according to Xinhua. Pictures from the scene, shared by the People's Daily newspaper group on Twitter, showed emergency responders walking among large mounds of rubble. China's president Xi Jinping on Saturday said rescue workers should do all they can to reach people buried by the landslides and minimize casualties. The landslide occurred in a hilly area of Sichuan, inhabited by Tibetans and another minority group, the Qiang people. A day earlier, two villagers died while four others were injured in Puge county of Sichuan province, also after rain-triggered landslides, Xinhua reported. China has been experiencing weeks of heavy summer rains that have caused extensive flooding and triggered landslides. In central China's Hunan and Hubei provinces, flooding has affected at least 390,000 people this week, Xinhua said, adding that 9,000 people have been evacuated. In some areas there was over 160 millimetres of rainfall in just one day. In the Hunan city of Yueyang, 47 reservoirs reportedly overflowed.

Videos published on social media showed fire had reached the second storey of the building which is partly residential. Windows were shattered in shops and buildings on the street.\",\n",

Amber Sinclair-Alexander has studied a joint honours in French, accounting and finance at Aberystwyth University, in Wales, for two years, and spent her third year in the South of France. Amber of Felixstowe Road, Edmonton, will fly out to Shanghai next month where she will gain vital experience at an asset management firm. \"This is an amazing opportunity,\" she said. \"As a joint honours student, it can be tricky to gain equal experience in both subject areas as they are both quite different.\" The Generation UK internship programme is funded through The British Council which provides placements and academic scholarships to UK students in China. As an intern Amber will attend conferences, phone clients, assist managers with day to day tasks and have the chance to pitch ideas to help build the company. She will also learn Mandarin which is spoken by over a billion people in China and will be a impressive skill to show prospective employees when she applies to be a chartered accountant. \"It will be a culture shock at first,\" explained Amber who will be provided with hotel accommodation during her stay. She will explore the city\\'s famous landmarks on day trips with other interns. Amber spent her third year of university as a teaching assistant in Perpignan, south of France, teaching English to French students and will graduate next week at a special ceremony. She speaks fluent French which she said will be useful on her placement as it is spoken by colleagues at the firm as well as English. Amber said she was \"shocked\" when she found out she had been selected for the internship. \"I was grateful when I found out that there were only six people chosen,\" she added. Professor Jo Crotty, director of the Institute of Business and Law at Aberystwyth University said: \"Amber\\'s feat in securing the Generation UK internship is testimony to the success of this strategy. \"We know that she will make good use of this opportunity and act as worthy ambassador for the department and the university.\"',\n",

Eight schools pitched their food and drink creations to judges at Millfield Theatre, in Silver Street, Edmonton, after taking part in the Cooking Enterprise Project over the summer term. Paul Everitt, Enfield Council\\'s head of arts and culture was on the judging panel on Thursday (July 13) along with Emma Rigby, founder of Facebook community group Love Your Doorstep. First prize was awarded to pupils from Cuckoo Hall Academy, in Cuckoo Hall Lane, who impressed judges with their healthy snack bar. Runners up were the crunchy munchy team at Galliard primary, in Galliard Road, who made a healthy oat bar. A fresh Greek salad and a tropical juice sensation won first place in the mini master chef competition created by Raynham Primary pupils, from Raynham Avenue. Youngsters were educated about healthy food through workshops and were encouraged to use fresh fruit and vegetables in their meals. After creating their own healthy food and drinks they sold them at their schools with the aim of making a profit. The project was organised by The Edmonton Community Partnership and run by Kinder Kitchen which provides educational workshops about making healthy food choices. \"The children and teachers enjoy taking part in such a fun initiative,\" said Renee Flourentzou, Edmonton Schools Partnership Manager. \"It\\'s a great way to learn about healthy cooking and business at the same time.\"',\n",
